# STACKSWORTH Edge 🧭  
### A 7" Touchscreen Bitcoin Dashboard

**STACKSWORTH Edge** is a **7" touchscreen Bitcoin dashboard** designed to display real-time Bitcoin data through a clean, touch-first interface.

Edge focuses on **clarity, visibility, and interaction**, offering a larger display than Pulse while remaining simpler and more streamlined than node-capable systems.

It is built for users who want a **dedicated Bitcoin dashboard** — without running a full node or managing backend infrastructure.

---

## 🔑 What Is Edge?

STACKSWORTH Edge is a **standalone touchscreen display** that presents Bitcoin metrics using local or remote data sources such as **SatoNak**.

It is designed to:
- Display live Bitcoin data
- Provide intuitive touch navigation
- Operate as an always-on dashboard
- Integrate cleanly into home, office, or studio environments

Edge does **not** run a Bitcoin node and does **not** control other STACKSWORTH devices.
